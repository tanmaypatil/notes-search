# resume-search-intelligence
Resume search using natural queries .  Demo application using openai RAG api and opensource VLM model to do resume analysis.

## Objective 
Objective of resume intelligence would be to support natural language query on a set of resumes .
It can be used to do comparative analysis of resumes .
Let us say , that we have 4 or 5 resumes of prospective software engineers
Some of the query , which it should allow you to fire are 
1. Does any of the candidates have team management experience ? 
2. Who has more experience in java and docker in set of resumes ?

## Approaches
Here i use RAG approaches 
1. RAG - with openai
   openai has assistant api , which has option of storing the vector representation of document and searching against the same .
   Refer here for documentation [File Search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search)
2. RAG - with opensource colpali
   This is approach of using VLM . I plan to use Byaldi which internally uses colpali
   Refer to notebook , which has sample code [chat with pdf using byaldi
   ](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/byaldi/blob/main/examples/chat_with_your_pdf.ipynb)

## Using openai file search 
This is a straightforward approach .I use openai apis to create a vector store and add all pdf documents to vector store . post that create a assistant and attach vector store to assistant 

Refer to this code in file_search api : 
```
    def search(vector_store_names: List[str], user_input : str):
    assistant_output = []
    """Search inside the openai vector store """
    # Set ranking options, including a score threshold (hypothetical)
    logging.info(f"vector search search prompt is {user_input}")
    logging.info(f"vector search , store names is {vector_store_names}")
    try:
        instructions = """
          You are an assistant specializing in scanning and analyzing technology resumes. Your goal is to identify key technical skills, experience, and alignment with job descriptions.
          1. **Technical Skills**: Focus on relevant programming languages, frameworks, tools, and certifications (e.g., Python, Java, AWS, Docker). Highlight these clearly.
          2. **Job Match**: Compare the resume with provided job descriptions. Focus on matching key technologies and job experience, and note areas where the candidate doesnâ€™t meet the requirements.
          3. **Projects & Experience**: Prioritize large-scale projects or leadership roles in tech teams. Identify open-source contributions or significant technical achievements.
